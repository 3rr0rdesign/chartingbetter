BET_SIZE=10  # $10 USDC per trade—start here, up to 20 if sim wins
STREAK_MIN=3  # Bet only after 3+ same outcomes (e.g., UPs)—bumps prob to 70%+
REVERSAL_PROB_BASE=0.70  # Base flip chance (from Kyle/backtests)—tweak to 0.65 if too picky
ADVANTAGE_THRESHOLD=0.05  # Buy if Chainlink edge >5% over Poly odds (e.g., 75% real vs. 70% implied)
PROFIT_TGT=0.96  # Sell limit at 96% of entry (your whale-pump target)
STOP_LOSS=0.60  # Stop at 60% (your cut-loss—tight for reversals)
LIQ_MIN=10000  # Skip markets under $10k liquidity (avoids slippage hell)

# Safety (Keeps You Sane)
DRY_RUN=true  # SIM MODE—logs "would buy $10 DOWN @0.12" without tx. Set false for live.
BACKTEST_DAYS=7  # Sim last 7 days' markets on run (logs win rate/EV)
MAX_TRADES_PER_HOUR=5  # Caps spam (Polymarket rate limits)
MIN_BALANCE_USDC=50  # Pauses if under $50 (refill buffer)
